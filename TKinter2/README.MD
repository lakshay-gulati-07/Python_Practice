##POMODORO

A Pomodoro app is a time management tool designed to improve focus and productivity using the Pomodoro Technique. This method breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros," followed by short breaks of 5 minutes. After completing four Pomodoros, users take a longer break, usually around 15-30 minutes. The app helps users track work and break intervals, manage tasks, and stay organized, making it ideal for those who want to maintain a balance between concentrated work and rest. 

This POMODORO Program is Developed Using TKinter Module In Python.
TKinter Module is standard library Used to Develop GUI(Graphical User Interface).
